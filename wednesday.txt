FADE IN:
EXT. NANCY REAGAN HIGH SCHOOL — DAY — TO ESTABLISH.

As all American as Hostess Cupcakes and the NRA. The sign
out front proudly declares, “NANCY REAGAN HIGH SCHOOL. HOME
OF THE MUSTANGS!”

INT. HALLWAY — NANCY REAGAN HIGH SCHOOL — DAY.

Pre-class insanity reigns. STUDENTS frantically crisscross
THE FRAME. Through the Technicolor THRONG of Jansport
backpacks and Brandy Melville ensembles, one face stands out.
Wearing a signature black dress and two perfect braids, meet

WEDNESDAY ADDAMS.

Her legendary wit is still sharper than razor wire and
puberty has amplified her uniquely warped worldview. She
cuts a line through her fellow students like a Great White
through a school of tuna. As she walks, she is met with
looks of fear or derision, both of which secretly please her.

					WEDNESDAY (V.O.)
			I’m not sure whose twisted idea it
			was to put hundreds of adolescents
			in underfunded schools run by
			people whose dreams were crushed
			years ago, but I admire the sadism.

Up ahead, she sees a GROUP OF STUDENTS gathered around a
locker. MUFFLED SCREAMS ECHO FROM INSIDE. As Wednesday
approaches, the teens guiltily scatter. Suspicious, she
wrenches open the locker door and out tumbles her brother

PUGSLEY ADDAMS.

He’s been hog-tied with an apple shoved in his mouth. She
unsympathetically yanks the apple free.

					WEDNESDAY
			I want names.

					PUGSLEY
			I don’t know who they were.
			Honest. It happened so fast...

He begins to blubber. Wednesday’s cool demeanor cracks.

					WEDNESDAY
			Pugsley, emotion equals weakness.
			Pull it together now.
